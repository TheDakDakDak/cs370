The code that was initially given was the TreasureMaze class which defined the environment for the pirate. Also given was the GameExperience class which managed the experiences of the agent doing the maze. What needed to be implemented was the actual Qlearning function in the ipynb file that I committed here to Github. I edited the qtrain function which managed the learning process itself by balancing exploration and exploitation as well as updating the model based on rewards and pentalties.

Computer scientists solve problems. Human hardware has limitations, foremost being speed, but also biases. For that reason, computer scientists make computers solve problems that humans alone would have difficulty with. In general when approaching a problem as a computer scientist, the first step is to fully understand the problem. Once it's understood, I think about how I would solve the problem step by step. Then taking things one very small step at a time, I'll translate that action that I would take into code that would instruct the computer take that step. The ethical responsibilities to the end user are to protect their privacy, give them the product that they need/want, and give them as much choice as possible in their use of the application as well as how their information is used.
